## Description 

- To put into practice the skills learned over your first year of studies.
- You have been tasked with creating a blog site. You can choose the design and topics covered on the blog, but it should have at least the following pages: Home page, About page,	List of blog posts,	Blog post specific pages,	Contact page.
- Create a prototype of the website in Adobe XD. 
- Home Page: The home page should have a ‘Latest Posts’ section which uses a carousel (slider) for users to click to view more posts. For example, by default the user can see four posts, then they can click an arrow on the right to view the next four posts, and click it again to view the next four posts. The user can also click back to view results they had previously seen.
- Blog Page: The blog posts page should show the first 10 blogs, and the user should click to view more results which then show underneath the first 10 blogs. You will need to add at least 12 blogs for your website. 
- Blog Specific Page: The content of the blog specific page should be dynamically built using a query string parameter based on whatever link the user clicked. The title of the blog specific page should change based on the blog that has been clicked on e.g. “My Blog | An Article I Wrote”. If images on the blog post page are clicked, a modal should appear giving the user a bigger view of that image. Clicking outside the image should hide the modal.
- Contact page with 4 textboxes; Name (Should be more than 5 characters long),	Email address (Must be a valid email address),	Subject (Should be more than 15 characters long), Message content (Should be more than 25 characters long). Please use JavaScript for validation, show error messages if the values in the textboxes do not meet the requirements.
- WordPress: The content for your website will be stored on a WordPress installation used as a Headless CMS. It’s important to note that we are only using WordPress to provide an API and add content for the blog. You should not submit a link to a WordPress site, but build your website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and making a call to the WordPress REST API to fetch the data. 
- Install Hotjar on your webpage, and ask users to test.
